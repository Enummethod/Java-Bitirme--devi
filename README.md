## Introduction

Under devolopment üõ†Ô∏è


### Technologies ‚öôÔ∏è
- Java
- Spring Framework
- Hibernate

Let's look at these three component

Hibernate handles data
Spring builds the Java app
Spring MVC makes the website content.

Hibernate provides a convenient bridge between Java code and the relational database where all your customer data is stored. Product lines, prices, orders, customer contact details(if you'r have one of these), shipping addresses will all be stored in this database.

A database is a thing that remembers information even after you stop the eCommerce application from running. Or switch the server computer off.

Spring provides a number of pre-built services that a Java program can use. The most important is a way to take all the separate pieces of Java code you have developed, and assemble them into an eCommerce application.

Spring also helps with other common eCommerce application tasks, like integrating a login system, for example.

Spring MVC is a part of SPring which helps build testable web pages. Your eCommerce site needs a visible part. It will showcase products, and allow orders to be submitted. Spring MVC helps create this part. Specifically, it helps bridge the gap between the web browser and the Java code itself.

So you roughly have a user, with a web browser, sending orders to Spring MVC, which turns these into Java objects for your custom application, which sends these to Hibernate, which prepares them for storage in the database.
